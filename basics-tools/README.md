# Basis Software & Tools

### IDE - Integrated Development Environment

If you want to start programming, you usually think in different functions which must be realised with various tools.
IDE joins togehter the tools needed for producing software products, by offering many functions and tools, as well as an user friendly environment for the programmer.
In the following, three different open-source IDEs will be presented.

## Examples for IDE

# Eclipse (IDE)

- published in 2001
- Known as IDE for Java programming
- is used by about 40% of Java programmers
- supports object oriented programming


- [Eclipse Download](https://www.heise.de/download/product/eclipse-ide-for-jee-developers-62100)
- [Youtube Eclipse & Java Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BgdXgWiaEY)
- [PDF for Java and Eclipse Introduction and exercises](http://www.mosbach.dhbw.de/fileadmin/user/public/personen/neuendorf/JUebung.pdf) 


# Visual Studio

- published by Microsoft in 1997
- latest version (March 2019) is "Visual Studio 2017"
- supports many different programming languages like C, C++, HTML, Python, JavaScript and can also be used for programming applications
- known as conveniant and user-friendly, by offering multiple extra functions and tools

# LiveCode

- object and GUI oriented IDE, published in 2001
- very "rookie" friendly, by automatically creating code when the frame is filled with objects like buttons etc.
- uses regular words and sentences in the code to make coding even easier for beginners
- made for applications and websites

## Text Editor
- Programs to edit text in multiple ways.
- Many of them are customizable and cross platform.
- Their functionality is simplistic, but if customizable also expandable.

### Typical Features
- Cut, copy, paste
- Find and replace
- Undo and redo
- Text formatting

### Advanced features
- Git integration (also GitHub, GitLab , ...)
- Syntax highlighting
- Autocompletion
- __Customization__

### Reasons to use a text editor?
- They are (if not extremely customized) much more simplistic than IDEs which makes them faster. If an IDE is not absolutely necessary or much more convenient for the task performed a text editor is a faster alternative.
- Example: Reading code does not require a build in debugger.

### Text Editors

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

## Terminal/ Command Line

- Means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text
- These commands are converted into appropriate operating system functions
- Command Prompt (Cmd) (Windows), Terminal (MacOS)

### General Pattern

- Prompt - generated by the program to provide context for the client
- Command - provided by the client
- param1 … paramM - optional parameters provided by the client. The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued

### Why use a Terminal/ Command-line interface?

- Better Control
- Speed
- System Resources
- CLI is Diverse
- Required for Backend Programming
- More Secure than GUI

## Package Manager

- share code with other users
- use other developers solutions
- code is shared through packages (modules)

### Examples [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

- NPM (Node Package Manager) and Yarn have similar functionalities
- both are open source
- command line tools
- packages in Java Srcipt
- install, uninstall and update packages
- versioning
- dependency management

## Code Formatter

- enforces code-formatting and/or code quality rules
- outputted code is conform to a consitent style

### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

- optionated code formatter
- reprints the entire programm in a predefined style
- only code formatting rules
- no help with code-quility rules
- supports: Java Sricpt, HTML, CSS, JSON, Mark Down

### [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

- Java Srcipt linting tool
- allows developers to discover problematic patterns without executing the code
- completely pluggable (combination with Prettier plug-in)
- developers can create their own rules
- supports: Java Script
